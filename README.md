### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Awolize - I'm a full stack developer. I'm interested in development and making life easier through software (and some hardware!). In my free time, I work on various projects, with most of my current ones stemming from my hobbies. However, there are also some older ones from my time at university. Please feel free to take a look around.
